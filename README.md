# Java Local Dir
I needed a quick way to get the executaion directory of my Java app. This turned out to be a little tricky, since Java doesn't make it easy to find.
So I figured it out and offer it for anyone that has the same, obscure need in Java

I posted this out on CodeProject late 2002 (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3373/Getting-a-Handle-on-the-Execution-Directory)
